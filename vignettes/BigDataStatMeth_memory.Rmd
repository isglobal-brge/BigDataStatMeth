# Overview

This package implements several matrix operations using `Matrix` and `DelayMatrix` objects as well as HDF5 data files. Some basic algebra operations that can also be computed that are useful to implement  statistical analyses using standard methodologies such as principal component analyses (PCA) or least squares estimation. The package also contains specific statistical methods mainly used in `omic` data analysis such as lasso regression. All procedures referred to HDF5 can be found in [BigDataStatMeth_hdf5](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/BigDataStatMeth/blob/master/vignettes/BigDataStatMeth_hdf5.html) vignette. 

# Prerequisites

The package requires other packages from `CRAN` and `Bioconductor` to be installed. 

- `CRAN`: `Matrix`, `RcppEigen` and `RSpectra`.
- `Bioconductor`: `DelayedArray` 

As the package can also deal with [hdf5 files](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) [See Vignette [BigDataStatMeth_hdf5](https://github.com/isglobal-brge/BigDataStatMeth/blob/master/vignettes/BigDataStatMeth_hdf5.html)], these other packages are required: `HDF5Array`, `rhdf5`. The user can execute this code to install the required packages:

```{r install_required, eval=FALSE}
# Install BiocManager (if not previously installed)
install.packages("BiocManager") 

# Install required packages
BiocManager::install(c("Matrix", "RcppEigen", "RSpectra", "DelayedArray",
                       "HDF5Array", "rhdf5"))
```

Our package needs to be installed from source code. In such cases, a collection of software (e.g. C, C++, Fortran,  etc.) are required, mainly for Windows users. These programs can be installed using [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).


# Install package

Once required packages and Rtools are installed, `BigDataStatMeth` package can be installed from our GitHub repository as follows:

```{r, install, eval=FALSE}
# Install devtools and load library (if not previously installed)
install.packages("devtools") 
library(devtools)

# Install BigDataStatMeth 
install_github("isglobal-brge/BigDataStatMeth")
```



# Getting started

First, let us start by loading the required packages to describe the main capabilities of the package

```{r, load}
library(Matrix)
library(DelayedArray)
library(BigDataStatMeth)
library(ggplot2)
```

This packages is also required to reproduce this vignette

```{r, load2}
library(microbenchmark)
```


# Matrix Multiplication

In this section, different products of matrices and vectors are introduced. The methods implement different strategies including block multiplication algorithms and the use of parallel implementations. 


## Block matrix multiplication

A block matrix or a partitioned matrix is a matrix that is interpreted as having been broken into sections called blocks or submatrices. Intuitively, a block matrix can be visualized as the original matrix with a collection of horizontal and vertical lines, which break it up, or partition it, into a collection of smaller matrices. the implementation has been made from the adaptation of the Fox algorithm [[1]](#1).


\[A*B=\begin{pmatrix} {A}_{11}&{A}_{12} \\ {A}_{21}&{A}_{22}\end{pmatrix}*\begin{pmatrix}{B}_{11}&B_{12}\\B_{21}&B_{22}\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}{C}_{11}&C_{12}\\C_{21}&C_{22}\end{pmatrix}=C\]

Let us simulate to set of matrices to illustrate the use of the function accross the entire documment. First, we simulate a simple case with to matrices A and B with dimensions 500x500 and 500x750, respectively. Second, another example with dimensions 1000x10000 are use to evaluate the performance in large matrices. The examples with big datasets will be illustrated using real data belonging to different omic settings. We can simulate to matrices with the desired dimensions by

```{r mat_sim}

# Define small matrix A and B
set.seed(123456)
n <- 500
p <- 750
A <- matrix(rnorm(n*n), nrow=n, ncol=n)
B <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p)


# Define big matrix Abig and Bbig
n <- 1000
p <- 10000
Abig <- matrix(rnorm(n*n), nrow=n, ncol=n)
Bbig <- matrix(rnorm(n*p), nrow=n, ncol=p)
```


Matrix multiplication using block matrices is implemented in the `bdblockmult()` function. It only requires to setting the argument `block_size`, by default `block_size = 128`. An optimal block size is important to better performance but it is difficult to asses what is the optimum block size for each matrix.

```{r blockmult }
# Use 10x10 blocks
AxB <- bdblockmult(A, B, block_size = 10)
```

As expected the results obtained using this procedure are the correct ones

```{r check_equal_x}
all.equal(AxB, A%*%B)
```

Note that when the argument `block_size` is larger than any of the dimensions of matrix A or B the `blocks_size` is set to `min(cols(A), rows(A), cols(B), rows(B))`. 

The process can be speed up by making computations in parallel using `paral=TRUE` an optional parameter threads can be used to indicate the number of `threads` to launch simultaneously, if `threads=NULL` the function takes the available threads - 1, leaving one available for user.

```{r blockmultparal}
AxB <- bdblockmult(A, B, block_size = 10, paral = TRUE)

all.equal(AxB,A%*%B)
```

To work with big matrices `bdblockmult()` can save matrices in hdf5 file format in order to be able to operate with them in blocks and not overload the memory, by default are considered large matrices if the number of rows or columns is greater than 5000, but it can be changed with `bigmatrix` argument. Or we can also force to execute the matrix multiplication with data on memory setting the parameter `onmemory = TRUE`


```{r blockmultbm1}
# We want to force it to run in memory
AxBNOBig <- bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, onmemory = TRUE) 

# Run matrix multiplication with data on memory using submatrices of 256x256
AxBBig3000 <- bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, block_size = 256 , onmemory = TRUE)
```


Here, we compare the performance of the block method with the different options.

```{r bench2, cache=FALSE}
bench1 <- microbenchmark( 
  # Parallel block size = 128
  Paral128Mem = bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, paral = TRUE), 
  # On disk parallel block size = 256
  Paral256Disk = bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, block_size=256, paral=TRUE), 
  Paral256Mem = bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, block_size=256, 
                            paral=TRUE, onmemory=TRUE),
  Paral1024Mem = bdblockmult(Abig, Bbig, block_size=1024, 
                             paral=TRUE, onmemory=TRUE), times = 3 )

bench1
```

We can observe that the shortest execution time is achieved with `block_size = 256`. 
The same information is depicted in the next Figure which illustrates the comparison between the different assessed methods

```{r, plotbench2, cache=FALSE}
ggplot2::autoplot(bench1)
```


## Sparse matrix multiplication

A sparse matrix or sparse array is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. `BigDataStatMeth` allows to perform matrix multiplication with sparse matrices using the function `bdblockmult_sparse`. It is necessary that at least one of the the two matrices is defined as sparse in R using `dgCMatrix` class. An example of a sparse matrix could be : 


\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    a_{11}&a_{12} & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & 0 \\
    a_{21}  & a_{22}  & a_{23}  & \ddots & && & \vdots \\
    0 & a_{32}  & a_{33} & a_{34}  & \ddots & &  & \vdots \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots &  & \vdots \\
    \vdots & & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots& \vdots\\
    \vdots  &  & & & \ddots & a_{n-1,n-2}  & a_{n-1,n-1}  &  a_{n-1,n}\\
    0 & \cdots &  \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & 0 & a_{n,n-1} & a_{n,n}  \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


```{r sparsematmult}
k <- 1e3

# Generate 2 sparse matrix x_sparse and y_sparse
set.seed(1)
x_sparse <- sparseMatrix(
   i = sample(x = k, size = k),
   j = sample(x = k, size = k),
   x = rnorm(n = k)
)

set.seed(2)
y_sparse <- sparseMatrix(
   i = sample(x = k, size = k),
   j = sample(x = k, size = k),
   x = rnorm(n = k)
)

d <- bdblockmult_sparse(x_sparse, y_sparse)
f <- x_sparse%*%y_sparse

all.equal(d,f)

```

Here, we compare the performace using sparse matrix multiplication with sparse matrices and the blockmult multiplication with the same matrices not declared as sparce.

```{r bench3, cache=FALSE}
res <- microbenchmark( 
  sparse_mult = bdblockmult_sparse(x_sparse, y_sparse),
  matrix_mult = bdblockmult(as.matrix(x_sparse), as.matrix(y_sparse)), 
  RSparse_mult = x_sparse%*% y_sparse, 
  times = 3 )

res
```

The same information is depicted in the next Figure which illustrates the comparison between the different assessed methods

```{r, plotbench3, cache=FALSE}
ggplot2::autoplot(res)
```

We can observe the huge difference in execution time



# Cross-product and Transposed Cross-product

To perform a cross-product and tcrossproduct with BigDataStatMeth we use the same function `bdcrossprod()` setting parameter `transposed` to TRUE or FALSE. Like other functions implemented in BigDataStatMeth, we can work with R Objects. Setting parameter transposed for Crossproduct and tCrossProduct

- if `transposed = FALSE` (default), we perform a Crossproduct \[\left( C \right) ={ \left( A \right)  }^{ t }\left( A \right) \]

- if `transposed = TRUE` :  we perform a transposed-Crossproduct \[\left( C \right) = \left( A \right){ \left( A \right)  }^{ t } \]

Here we shown some examples using `bdcrossprod` function

```{r crossprod }
n <- 500
m <- 250
A <- matrix(rnorm(n*m), nrow=n, ncol=m)

# Cross Product of a standard R matrix
cpA <- bdCrossprod(A)
```

We obtain the expected values computed using `crossprod` R function

```{r check_cp}
all.equal(cpA, crossprod(A))
```

you may also set `transposed=TRUE`

```{r nocrossprod}
# Transposed Cross Product R matrices
tcpA <- bdtCrossprod(A)
```

We obtain the expected values computed using `tcrossprod` function

```{r check_tcp}
all.equal(tcpA, tcrossprod(A))
```

We can show that the implemented version really improves the  R implementation computational speed.

```{r benchmark_bdcrossprod}
res <- microbenchmark(
  bdcrossp_tr = bdtCrossprod(A),
  rcrossp_tr = tcrossprod(A),
  bdcrossp = bdCrossprod(A),
  rcrossp = crossprod(A),
  times = 3)
res
```

```{r, plotbenchmark_bdcrossprod}
ggplot2::autoplot(res)
```



# Matrix Vector Multiplication

You can perform a weighted cross-product $C = X^ t w X$ with `bdwcrossprod()` given a matrix X as argument and a vector or matrix of weights, w.

## Weighted Cross-product and Weighted Transposed Cross-product

```{r wcrossprod }
n <- 250
X <- matrix(rnorm(n*n), nrow=n, ncol=n)
u <- runif(n)
w <- u * (1 - u)

wcpX <- bdwproduct(X, w,"xwxt")

wcpX[1:5,1:5]
```

Those are the expected values as it is indicated by executing:

```{r check_wcp}
all.equal( wcpX, X%*%diag(w)%*%t(X) )
```


## Weighted Transposed Cross Product

With argument `transposed=TRUE`, we can perform a transposed weighted cross-product $C = A w A^t$

```{r wtcrossprod }
wtcpX <- bdwproduct(X, w,"xtwx")

wtcpX[1:5,1:5]
```

Those are the expected values as it is indicated by executing:

```{r check_wtcp}
all.equal(wtcpX, t(X)%*%diag(w)%*%X)
```

# Inverse Cholesky

The Cholesky factorization is widely used for solving a system of linear equations whose coefficient matrix is symmetric and positive definite.

\[A = LL^t = U^tU\]

where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. To get the Inverse Cholesky we can use the function `bdInvCholesky()`. Let us start by illustrating how to do this computations in a simulated data:


```{r invChols }
# Generate a positive definite matrix
Posdef <- function (n, ev = runif(n, 0, 10))
{
  Z <- matrix(ncol=n, rnorm(n^2))
  decomp <- qr(Z)
  Q <- qr.Q(decomp)
  R <- qr.R(decomp)
  d <- diag(R)
  ph <- d / abs(d)
  O <- Q %*% diag(ph)
  Z <- t(O) %*% diag(ev) %*% O
  return(Z)
}

A <- Posdef(n = 500, ev = 1:500)

invchol <- bdInvCholesky(A)

round(invchol[1:5,1:5],8)
```

We can check whether this function returns the expected values obtained with the standard R function `solve`:
```{r invCholsequal }
all.equal(invchol, solve(A))
```


We can show that the implemented version really improves the  R implementation computational speed.

```{r benchmark_invChol}
res <- microbenchmark(invchol = bdInvCholesky(A),
                      invcholR = solve(A),
                      times = 3)
res
```

```{r, plotbenchmark_invChol}
ggplot2::autoplot(res)
```


# Pseudo-Inverse

The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is a direct application of the SVD. The inverse of a matrix A can be used to solve the equation ${Ax}={b}$. But in the case where the set of equations have 0 or many solutions the inverse cannot be found and the equation cannot be solved. The following formula is used to find the pseudoinverse: 
\[{A}^+= {VD}^+{U}^T\]
In BigDataStatMeth we implemented Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse in function `bdpseudoinv`, now we get the pseudoinverse from a simulated data

```{r pseudoinv }

m <- 1300
n <- 1200

A <- matrix(rnorm(n*m), nrow=n, ncol=m)

pseudoinv <- bdpseudoinv(A)
zapsmall(pseudoinv)[1:5,1:5]
```


# QR Factorization


QR decomposition, also known as a QR factorization or QU factorization is a decomposition of a matrix A into a product : 
\[A = QR\]
of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. QR decomposition is often used to solve the linear least squares problems. 

In BigDataStatMeth we implemented QR decomposition in function `bdQR`, the QR decomposition can be performed in R objects. To show how to use this function we performa a QR decomposition from the previous simulated data in matrix A.

```{r QRdecomp }


QR_A <- bdQR(A)
QR_R <- qr(A)

# Show results for Q
zapsmall(QR_A$Q[1:5,1:5])

# Show results for R
zapsmall(QR_A$R[1:5,1:5])

# Test Q 
all.equal(QR_A$Q, qr.Q(QR_R), check.attributes=FALSE)

```


# Solve matrix equation

In BigDataStatMeth we implemented the function `bdSolve` that computes the solution to a real system of linear equations 

\[A*X = B\]
where A is an N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-K matrices.

Here we solve a matrix equation with a squared matrix A (1000 by 1000) and B matrix (1000 by 2)

```{r matrix_matrixEQ }

# Simulate data
m <- 1000
n <- 1000

A <- matrix(runif(n*m), nrow = n, ncol = m)
B <- matrix(runif(n*2), nrow = n)

# Solve matrix equation
X <- bdSolve(A, B)

# Show results
X[1:5,]

```

Now we check results multiplying matrix A by results X, if all is correct $A*X = B$ 

```{r check_matrix_matrixEQ }

testB <- bdblockmult(A,X)

B[1:5,]
testB[1:5,]

all.equal(B, testB)

```



# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

The SVD of an $m \times n$ real or complex matrix $A$ is a factorization of the form:

$$U\Sigma { V }^{ T }$$

where :

-$U$ is a $m \times m$ real or complex unitary matrix
-$\Sigma$ is a $m \times n$ rectangular diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal
-$V$ is a $n \times n$ real or complex unitary matrix.

Notice that:

- The diagonal entries $\sigma_i$ of $\Sigma$ are known as the singular values of $A$.
- The columns of $U$ are called the left-singular vectors of $A$.
- The columns of $V$ are called the right-singular vectors of $A$.

## Simple Singular Values Decomposition
He have implemented the SVD for R matrices in the function `bdSVD()`. The method, so far, only allows SVD of real matrices $A$.  This code illustrate how to perform such computations:

```{r svd_default}
# Matrix simulation
set.seed(413)
n <- 500
A <- matrix(rnorm(n*n), nrow=n, ncol=n)

# SVD
bsvd <- bdSVD(A)

# Singular values, and right and left singular vectors
bsvd$d[1:5]
bsvd$u[1:5,1:5]
bsvd$v[1:5,1:5]
```

We get the expected results obtained with standard R functions:

```{r check_svd}
all.equal( sqrt( svd( tcrossprod( scale(A) ) )$d[1:10] ), bsvd$d[1:10] )
```

you get the $\sigma_i$, $U$ and $V$ of normalized matrix $A$, if you want to perform the SVD from not normalized matrix $A$ then you have to set the parameter `bcenter = false` and `bscale = false`.

```{r svd_nonorm}
bsvd <- bdSVD(A, bcenter = FALSE, bscale = FALSE)


bsvd$d[1:5]
bsvd$u[1:5,1:5]
bsvd$v[1:5,1:5]

all.equal( sqrt(svd(tcrossprod(A))$d[1:10]), bsvd$d[1:10] )

```

## Block Singular Values Decomposition

A method developed by M. A. Iwen and B. W. Ong uses a distributed and incremental SVD algorithm that is useful for agglomerative data analysis on large networks. The algorithm calculates the singular values and left singular vectors of a matrix A, by first, partitioning it by columns. This creates a set of submatrices of A with the same number of rows, but only some of its columns. After that, the SVD of each of the submatrices is computed. The final step consists of combining the results obtained by merging them again and computing the SVD of the resulting matrix. 

This approach is only implemented using HDF5 files. This method is implemented in `bdSVD_hdf5` function, this function works directly on hdf5 data format, loading in memory only the data to perform calculations and saving the results again in the hdf5 file for later use. The user is referred to read [section 7.3.1 from this vignette](https://rpubs.com/jrgonzalezISGlobal/BigDatStatMeth_hdf5).




# Using algebra procedure to implement basic statistical methods


## Principal component analysis (PCA)

Let us illustrate how to perform a PCA using miRNA data obtained from TCGA corresponding to 3 different tumors: melanoma (ME), leukemia (LEU) and centran nervous system (CNS). Data is available at `BigDataStatMeth` and can be loaded by simply:

```{r mirNA}
data(miRNA)
data(cancer)
dim(miRNA)
```

We observe that there are a total of 21 individuals and 537 miRNAs. The vector `cancer` contains the type of tumor of each individual. For each type we have:

```{r tab}
table(cancer)
```

Now, the typical principal component analysis on the samples
can be run on the `miRNA` matrix since it has miRNAs in columns and individuals in rows

```{r pca}
pc <- prcomp(miRNA)
```

We can plot the two first components with:

```{r plot_pca}
plot(pc$x[, 1], pc$x[, 2],
     main = "miRNA data on tumor samples",
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", type="n")
abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2)
points(pc$x[, 1], pc$x[, 2], col = cancer,
       pch=16, cex=1.2)
legend("topright", levels(cancer), pch=16, col=1:3)
```

The PCA is equivalent to performing the SVD on the centered data, where the centering occurs on the columns. In that case the function `bdSVD` requires to set the argument `bcenter` and `bscale` equal to TRUE, the dafault values.

```{r cia_da}
miRNA.c <- sweep(miRNA, 2, colMeans(miRNA), "-")
svd.da <- bdSVD(miRNA.c, bcenter = FALSE, bscale = FALSE)
```


The PCA plot for the two principal components can then be be obtained by:

```{r plot_svd_da}
plot(svd.da$u[, 1], svd.da$u[, 2],
     main = "miRNA data on tumor samples",
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2", type="n")
abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2)
points(svd.da$u[, 1], svd.da$u[, 2], col = cancer,
       pch=16, cex=1.2)
legend("topright", levels(cancer), pch=16, col=1:3)
```

We can observe that both figures are equal irrespective to a sign change of second component (that can happen in SVD).
