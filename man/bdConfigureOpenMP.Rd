\title{Configure OpenMP threads with intelligent optimization}
\usage{
bdConfigureOpenMP(threads, apply_optimizations = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{threads}{Number of threads to use (required)}

\item{apply_optimizations}{Whether to apply system-specific optimizations (default: TRUE)}
}
\description{
Allows users to specify the exact number of threads while applying

\examples{
# On a 128-core server, use only 32 threads with optimizations

# Use 48 threads without system optimizations
bdConfigureOpenMP(48, apply_optimizations = FALSE)

# Check what was configured
bdGetSystemInfo()
