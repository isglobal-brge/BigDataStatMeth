\title{Get I/O-aware thread recommendation}
\usage{
bdGetOptimalThreads(
  matrix_rows,
  matrix_cols,
  operation_type = "multiplication",
  max_threads = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_rows}{Number of rows in your matrix}

\item{matrix_cols}{Number of columns in your matrix}

\item{operation_type}{Type of operation (default: "multiplication")}

\item{max_threads}{Maximum threads to consider (optional)}
}
\value{
Integer with recommended thread count
}
\description{
Returns the optimal number of threads for your specific matrix size
and operation, considering I/O bottlenecks, storage characteristics,
and system constraints. This function performs the same analysis as
the internal optimization but returns the result without applying it.
}
\details{
The recommendation considers:
\itemize{
\item Storage I/O capacity (1 for HDD, 4 for SSD, 8 for NVMe)
\item I/O to computation ratio for the specific operation
\item System type (HPC cluster, server, desktop)
\item Memory constraints on large systems (>64 cores)
\item Job scheduler allocations (SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK, PBS_NCPUS)
\item CRAN compliance requirements
}
}
\note{
This function does not modify any OpenMP settings,
use bdConfigureIO() to apply the recommendations
}
\examples{
# Get recommendation for your workload
threads <- bdGetOptimalThreads(5000, 5000, "multiplication")
cat("Recommended threads:", threads, "\n")

# Limit maximum threads
threads <- bdGetOptimalThreads(10000, 10000, "svd", max_threads = 16)

# Use recommendation in manual configuration
# omp_set_num_threads(threads)
}
