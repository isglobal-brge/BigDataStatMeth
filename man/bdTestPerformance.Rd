\title{Quick performance test for current thread configuration}
\usage{
bdTestPerformance(test_size = 2000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{test_size}{Size of test matrix (default: 2000)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector with timing in milliseconds
}
\description{
Performs a simple matrix operation to test the performance
of the current thread configuration. Useful for measuring
the impact of I/O-aware optimization and comparing different
configurations.
}
\details{
The test performs a matrix multiplication of two random matrices
of size test_size Ã— test_size. This operation uses the current
OpenMP configuration and provides a benchmark for computational
performance under the current thread settings.

The test is CPU-intensive and may not reflect I/O-bound BigDataStatMeth
operations, but provides a baseline for thread configuration effectiveness.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item Larger test sizes provide more stable timing but take longer
\item Results may vary between runs due to system load
\item This test uses in-memory matrices, not HDF5 I/O
}
}
\examples{
# Test current performance
time_ms <- bdTestPerformance()
cat("Test completed in", time_ms, "milliseconds\n")

# Compare different configurations
time_before <- bdTestPerformance()
bdConfigureIO(5000, 5000, "multiplication")
time_after <- bdTestPerformance()

# Compare results
improvement <- time_before / time_after
cat("Performance improvement:", improvement, "x\n")

# Test with larger matrices for more stable results
time_stable <- bdTestPerformance(test_size = 3000)
}
