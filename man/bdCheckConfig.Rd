\title{Check current BigDataStatMeth thread configuration}
\usage{
bdCheckConfig()
}
\value{
List with current configuration details
}
\description{
Shows the current OpenMP thread configuration and system information.
Useful for verifying that optimization has been applied correctly,
understanding system characteristics, and debugging performance issues.
}
\details{
Returned list contains:
\itemize{
\item version - BigDataStatMeth version
\item current_threads - Currently configured OpenMP threads
\item available_cores - Total CPU cores available
\item system_type - Detected system type (HPC/Server/Desktop/CRAN/Container)
\item storage_type - Detected storage type (HDD/SSD/NVMe/Network/Unknown)
\item is_hpc - Whether HPC environment was detected
\item is_cran - Whether CRAN compliance mode is active
\item is_container - Whether container environment was detected
\item optimization_active - Whether I/O-aware optimization appears active
\item thread_efficiency - Ratio of current threads to available cores
\item memory_info - Available memory information (if detectable)
\item environment_vars - Relevant environment variables
}
}
\note{
This function only reads current settings and does not
modify any configuration
}
\examples{
# Check current configuration

# Check thread efficiency
if (config$thread_efficiency < 0.5) {
  message("Conservative threading detected - likely I/O optimized")
