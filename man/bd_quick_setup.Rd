}
\details{
This function combines several optimization steps:
\itemize{
\item Detects your system type and storage characteristics
\item Analyzes I/O intensity for your typical workload
\item Applies optimal OpenMP configuration
\item Optionally shows detailed diagnostic information
}

Common operation types:
\itemize{
\item "multiplication" - Matrix multiplication (A \\%\emph{\\% B)
\item "svd" - Singular Value Decomposition
\item "crossprod" - Cross-product (t(A) \\%}\\% A)
\item "pca" - Principal Component Analysis
}
